# Project---Introduction-to-Transfer-Learning-Cat-vs-Non-cats-Project-
Welcome to this project on Cat vs Non-cat Classifier using Transfer Learning. In this project, you will use Python and Keras to apply the Transfer Learning technique in order to build an image classifier, and apply it to predict the class of an input image - whether it is a cat or a non-cat.
